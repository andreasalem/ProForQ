    "Almost all countries in the world have developed a system and the infrastructure to record and approximate the unemployment rate of the labor force as accurately as possible. In order to understand its significance we shall agree on a clear definition in more detail than what was provided earlier. There are numerous definitions since the methodology for calculating the unemployment rate often varies among countries. Different definitions of employment and unemployment, as well as different data sources are used but the consensus is the following: unemployed people are those who are willing and available to work, and who have actively sought work within the past four weeks. Students, prisoners, or for example handicapped people do not match the definition and are not considered as unemployed but out of the labor force.\n",

    "Another type of data useful to provide us with insight concerning the European Labor Market is the transitions rates. They tell us how fast or how likely an individual move from a category to another. There are 9 different transitions formed by the 3 states a person can be in : 'U' for unemployed, 'E' for employed, and 'N' for out of the labor force. Therefore we can explicit all the different transitions from a period to another (t to t+1) by a matrix 3x3:\n",

    "We can then analyse different indicators such as the EU + EN -> Job Destruction rate & UE + NE -> Job finding rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, it is important to mention that we calculate transition rates and not exactly the probability to move from 1 state to another because of the following reasons. The way data is collected tells us how many people move across states **for a given period** and with those data we can compute the transitions rates. For example the UE transition rate (let's call the variable *rate_UE*) tells us the proportion of unemployed people that went from unemployment to employment during a given period. To calculate it, we divide the number of people that transitioned from the initial state to the target state by the number of people in the initial state and. This yields our variable *rate_UE*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many transitions can happen at any time between the person is surveyed the 1st time and the second. The current data only measure the transition from point a to point b but not what happens in between. Since Eurostat does not register data in continuous but in a discret manner and changes happen in continuous, the transition rates are only an approximative of the probability to move from 1 state to another.

    "To compute the transitions rate we need to iterate over all the possible combinations of `['E','U','N']` and check that all the computed rates are in the [0,1] interval. In order to do the later, we can define a function that uses `DataFrame.min()` and `DataFrame.max()`. The function warns us if a value in the rows or column of the Dataframe is smaller than 0 or bigger than 1 since they represent probabilities. . max().max() will look at the maximum of the rows and maximum of the columns and similarily for min().min(). We don't have to check every single value because if the maximum and minimum values fulfill this criterium, the rest of the values will be okay, if not, we have to check the whole code anyway."

It tests whether the p value is less than .05 (where the p-value is a hypothesis test). The R-squared value tells you how much variation in y is explained by x. \n",
