    "The easiest way to handle our data is a [`pandas.DataFrame`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html). Fortunately, Pandas as a useful function to read Excel files and create DataFrames out of them: [`pandas.read_excel`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_excel.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, depending on the shape of the data, there can be difficulties when handling Excel files with pandas. In our case that includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rows at the beginning of the spreadsheet that don't contain the data we're looking for and that we'd therefore like to skip when reading the Excel into a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The shape of the Excel file is not in the way that would be conventional for [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/). The index (the time period) is usually in the rows instead of the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Eurostat records missing data with \":\" and a separate sheet for flags, while NaN is the proper way to record missing observations. This means we'll have to set all the missing observations to *NaN*.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Some Country names, for example \"Germany (until 1990 former territory of the FRG)\" are in a format that makes it hard to use them in loops and other functionalities of python.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. To work efficiently with `pandas` classes, it is important to use the right [indexing](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html). In this case we are dealing with (a set of) [time series](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html), so we want the index to have the proper functionality. In particular, our data refers to a full calendar year quarter which can be represented using a [period](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html). This sort of information cannot be read from the Excel file as the reference to the quarters there is just a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning, let's load the first sheet containing the actual data into a `pandas.DataFrame`. In this case, the `pd.read_excel` function gets five inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *aux_name*, the name and location of the file. We store it in a variable right away, that way the code is more readable and we can easily change it later\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *skiprows*, the information to skip the first 11 rows, these are the rows that don't contain necessary information\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *index_col*, which column to use as the DataFrame's index\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *sheet_name*, which of the Excel's sheets to use, the default would be 0, the first sheet"

    "Another type of data useful to provide us with insight concerning the European Labor Market is the transitions rates. They tell us how fast or how likely an individual move from a category to another. There are 9 different transitions formed by the 3 states a person can be in : 'U' for unemployed, 'E' for employed, and 'N' for out of the labor force. Therefore we can explicit all the different transitions from a period to another (t to t+1) by a matrix 3x3:\n",
    "\n",
    "|*Today/tomorrrow*|E|U|N|\n",
    "|:-----:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n",
    "|**E**|EE|EU|EN|\n",
    "|**U**|UE|UU|UN|\n",
    "|**N**|NE|NU|NN|\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then analyse different indicators such as the EU + EN -> Job Destruction rate & UE + NE -> Job finding rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, it is important to mention that we calculate transition rates and not exactly the probability to move from 1 state to another because of the following reasons. The way data is collected tells us how many people move across states **for a given period** and with those data we can compute the transitions rates. For example the UE transition rate (let's call the variable *rate_UE*) tells us the proportion of unemployed people that went from unemployment to employment during a given period. To calculate it, we divide the number of people that transitioned from the initial state to the target state by the number of people in the initial state and. This yields our variable *rate_UE*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many transitions can happen at any time between the person is surveyed the 1st time and the second. The current data only measure the transition from point a to point b but not what happens in between. Since Eurostat does not register data in continuous but in a discret manner and changes happen in continuous, the transition rates are only an approximative of the probability to move from 1 state to another. Plus, since those rates should approximate probabilities, they can not be negative or greater than 1.\n",

    "1. The `{}` brackets: They specify at which part of the string something from the `.format()` section should be put in.\n",

    "To compute the transitions rate we need to iterate over all the possible combinations of `['E','U','N']` and check that all the computed rates are in the [0,1] interval. In order to do the later, we can define a function that uses `DataFrame.min()` and `DataFrame.max()`. The function warns us if a value in the rows or column of the Dataframe is smaller than 0 or bigger than 1 since they represent probabilities. . max().max() will look at the maximum of the rows and maximum of the columns and similarily for min().min(). We don't have to check every single value because if the maximum and minimum values fulfill this criterium, the rest of the values will be okay, if not, we have to check the whole code anyway."
